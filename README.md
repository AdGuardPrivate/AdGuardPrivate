This project is forked from AdGuardHome and offers a SaaS hosted version on [Adguard Private](https://adguardprivate.com). Compared to the original version, it includes more customizable features, specifically:

1. **DNS routing based on rule lists**, which can be customized in the configuration file, supporting third-party rules like [Loyalsoldier/v2ray-rules-dat](https://github.com/Loyalsoldier/v2ray-rules-dat).

2. **Support for configuring the blocking of sources from specific applications**, capable of receiving third-party configurations to block application sources, providing more flexible management capabilities.

3. **Support for DDNS functionality**, dynamic domain name resolution capabilities to meet more scenario needs.

4. **More advanced rate limiting measures**, offering more efficient traffic management and control.

In addition to one-click deployment, AdGuardPrivate also provides the following enhanced features:

- **Load balancing support**
- **Automatic certificate maintenance**
- **Optimized network connections**
